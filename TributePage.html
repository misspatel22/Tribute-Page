                    The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet), located near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel is highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India to form the single Union of India. The statue is located in Gujarat on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the city of Vadodara.

                        Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel was an Indian barrister, politician, and one of the leading figures of the country during the Indian freedom movement. During the first three years of Indian independence after 1947, he served as Deputy Prime Minister, Home Minister, Minister of Information, and Minister of State.
                        <br>
                        In 2014, the Government of India decided to celebrate the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as the "National Unity Day" to honour Sardar Patel's contribution to integrated India. Since then, 31 October (the date of birth of Sardar Patel) is celebrated as the "National Unity Day".
                        <br>
                        Apart from this, the world's tallest statue, the 'Statue of Unity', was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018, which is about 182 meters (597 ft) high.
                        <br>
                        Not many can achieve in several lifetimes what Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was able to excel in one lifetime. He managed to lead as a political leader and was also beloved by the crowds and masses. After his death, many officers and the national police force along with the country mourned his death. He was truly loved and his strength of character also shines as he never shied away from handling the financial burdens of his family. He was a great man and deserved the title of "patron saint of India's civil servants" and the “Iron man of India”.
